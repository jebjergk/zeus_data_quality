# Pull Request Workflow FAQ

## Can I create a new PR after closing one on GitHub?
Yes. Closing a pull request does not delete your branch or your commits. You can reopen the same PR or push new commits and open a fresh pull request from the same branch (or a different branch) whenever you are ready. Just make sure the branch is pushed to the remote and then use the **New pull request** button in GitHub to start over.

## Tips
- If the previous PR had review feedback, keep the branch and push follow-up commits that address the comments before opening the new PR.
- Alternatively, create a new branch from the updated base branch, cherry-pick the relevant commits, and open a new PR to start with a clean history.
- Remember to link the previous, closed PR in the description of the new one so reviewers can see the context.
